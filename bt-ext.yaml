  description: 'Temporarily sets <Better Thermostat - Entity> to a different temporary <Target temperature> depending on a presence, schedule and partymode. 

  
  Sets the configured <Target temperature> at the <Better Thermostat - Entity> when
  
  * the <Schedule> is currently set to off
  
  or
  
  * the <Person> is currently not in the <Zone>.
  

  Otherwise, the heating temperature set on the Better Thermostat is restored.


  To activate the BT even if the <Schedule> is switched off or the <Person> is not in the <Zone>, the party mode can be activated via a switch.
  
  After the <Partymode> has been switched on, it is automatically deactivated again after the time period <Duration for Partymode>.
